C  NMHKTYPE is the number of MHK types
C  NFLAGPWR is a flag to indicate power curve calculation type (1=calculate from ~cube of velocity, 2=user-defined power curve)
C  UPSTREAM is a flag to indicate if you use the velocity in the cell of the MHK (0) or upstream of it (1)
C  OUTPUTFLAG (see below)
C
C  If NFLAGPWR=1 then input NMHKTYPE lines of the following variables:
C  WIDTHMHK is the width of MHK device type
C  WIDTHSUP is the width of MHK support structure type
C  BOFFMHK is the bottom offset of the MHK device type (how far from the bottom)
C  BOFFSUP is the bottom offset of the MHK support structure type
C  TOFFMHK is the top offset of the MHK device type
C  TOFFSUP is the top offset of the MHK support structure type
C  CTMHK is the thrust coefficient of MHK device type
C  CDSUP is the coefficient of power dissipation of MHK support structure type
C  VMINCUT is the minimum velocity cut-in for MHK device type power curve
C  VMAXCUT is the maximum velocity cut-out for MHK device type power curve
C  DENMHK is the number of MHK devices in a cell
C
C  If NFLAGPWR=2 then input NMHKTYPE entries of the following variables:
C  NPWRCRV is the number of points on user-defined power curve, by device type
C  VPWRCRV is the velocity value on user-defined power curve
C  PPWRCRV is the corresponding power dissipation value on user-defined power curve
